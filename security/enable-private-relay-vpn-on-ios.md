# Enable Private Relay VPN On iOS

__Category: Security__

iOS 15 and above provide Private Relay for iCloud users in certain countries to protect their privacy. Private Relay is used when browsing in Safari to hide your IP address and identity using transport-level encryption and functions similarly to a VPN (although Apple are careful not to refer to it as a VPN).

iCloud Private Relay lets you choose your IP address location. You can choose your "general IP address" so that websites can still give you some location data, or you can choose an IP address somewhere in your country and time zone for more anonymity, but less tailored online content.

To enable private relay:

Go to Settings -> [your name] -> iCloud -> Private Relay

You can press IP Address Location to choose a setting for your IP address.

* Maintain General Location - allows sites to show you localized content in Safari, while your IP address stays hidden
* Use Country and Time Zone - uses a broader location for your IP address, within your country and time zone

Private Relay may not work in all situations and will automatically be disabled in countries that don't support it.
