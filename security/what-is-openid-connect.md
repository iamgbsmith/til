# What Is OpenID Connect

__Category: Security__

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer on top of OAuth2. It allows clients to verify the identity of a user based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server. User claims such as name, email, or address may be shared on request. Single-page applications, native, and mobile apps can use OIDC to identify users.

OIDC uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT), a special scope value (“openid”), and the use of an extra token called the ID Token which encapsulates the identity claims in JSON format. It has an emphasis on authentication rather than authorization.

In OIDC, the term “flow” is used in place of OAuth2 “grant”.
