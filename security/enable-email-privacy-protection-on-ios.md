# Enable Email Privacy Protection On iOS

__Category: Security__

iOS 15 and above provides Mail Privacy Protection to help protect your privacy in the Mail app by preventing email senders from learning information about your activity. It also prevents senders from seeing if you have opened the email they sent you.

When enabled, your IP address is hidden so that senders are unable to link it to your online activity or determine your location. 

To enable email privacy protection:

Go to Settings -> Mail -> Privacy Protection.

Turn on "Protect Mail Activity".
