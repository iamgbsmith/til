# What Is Azure Static Web Apps

__Category: Azure__

### Overview

Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) facilitates the development of modern full stack web applications through integration with a code repository such as GitHub or Azure DevOps. Deployment automatically occurs when code is published to a repository branch.

Azure SWA supports single-page apps (SPAs) built using libraries and frameworks Angular, Gatsby, Next.js, React, Svelte, Vue, or Blazor. Server Side Rendering (SSR) is not supported.

Static assets such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are served from a geographically distributed Content Delivery Network for optimal page-load performance.

* API endpoints used by Azure SWA are hosted using Azure Functions.
* Authentication provider integration includes Azure Active Directory, Apple, Facebook, GitHub, Google, Twitter, and OIDC.
* Apps deployed using the Production plan can have up to 10 staging environments, 5 custom domains, and an app size of 500MB.
