# Activate An Azure PIM Group

__Category: Azure__

Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is used to assign access to Azure AD roles and Azure resources (subscriptions). PIM features just-in-time and time-bound access for Azure.

To activate a PIM role, log into the Azure Portal.

Navigate or search for "AZure AD Privileged Identity Management" to manage access.

Select My roles -> Groups from the left-hand menu.

From the list of Eligible assigments shown, press "Activate" for the role you want to enable.

You will be prompted to specify a duration and enter a reason for activation. Once you have done this, press "Activate"

Navigate back to the Azure portal landing page and start working with the necessary resources.

__Note:__ If the resource access you need does not show up, refresh the portal landing page then select the necessary Azure service.
