# What Is Azure ExpressRoute

__Category: Azure__

Azure ExpressRoute connects on-premise networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection. Organizations can establish connections to Microsoft Azure or Microsoft 365. 

ExpressRoute supports dynamic scaling of bandwidth on a best-effort basis.

### Connectivity options

The three connectivity options supported are:

* Point-to-point Ethernet connection 
* Any-to-any (IP VPN) connection
* CloudExchange colocation (a virtual cross-connection through a connectivity provider at a colocation facility)

Connections do not go over public internet. This allows for faster speeds, better security, consistent latency and more reliability.

### Billing options

There are three billing models for ExpressRoute:

* Unlimited data - all inbound and outbound data transfer is charged for a flat monthly fee
* Metered data - all outbound data transfer is charged for per GB of data sent (transfer rates vary by region)
* ExpressRoute premium add-on - increases route limits and provides global connectivity for services across regions

### ExpressRoute Direct

ExpressRoute Direct provides connections into Microsoft's global network at peering locations strategically distributed across the world with dual 100 Gbps active/active connectivity.
