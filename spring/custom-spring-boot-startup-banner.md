# Custom Spring Boot Startup Banner

__Category: Spring__

You can customise the banner that is displayed on startup for a Spring Boot application by copying your `banner.txt` file to `/src/main/resources/banner.txt`

[TAAG](http://patorjk.com/software/taag) provides a way to generate ASCII art for banner files with dozens of fonts to choose from.
