# Remove The Background From An Image

__Category: Mac__

You can remove the background from an image using Preview.

Open the image.

From the tools menu click the Show Markup Toolbar button.

Click the "Instant Alpha" button (which looks like a magic wand) on the toolbar.

Drag the cursor over the part of the background you want to remove.

Delete the selected area by pressing the delete button.

If you need to delete everything outside the selected area, choose Edit -> Invert Selection, then press delete.
