# Manage Cluttered Desktops

__Category: Mac__

If your current desktop is getting too cluttered, you can create a new desktop (space) from Mission Control. 

To create a new space, swipe up on the trackpad with three fingers.

Press the `+` icon.

Click the thumbnail for a space to open it.

You can move between spaces by swiping left or right on the trackpad with three fingers (or two on the mouse). Alternatively, hold down `ctrl` key with left or right arrow key. 

See [Work in multiple spaces on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh14112/mac) for more details.
