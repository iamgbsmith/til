# Show Hidden Display Resolutions

__Category: Mac__

If you are experiencing poor picture quality with an external monitor you can show the hidden display resolutions which will allow you to try running the monitor with a different resolution.

Open System Preferences -> Displays. Then select the external Display. On the Display Tab, start by selecting the default mode of 'Best for Display', then hold down the `option` key while selecting the 'Scaled' option.

From here, select the desired resolution which matches the optimal choice for your external monitor.
