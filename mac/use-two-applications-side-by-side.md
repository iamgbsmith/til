# Use Two Applications Side By Side

__Category: Mac__

You can use two applications side by side using Split View.

Click and hold the green full-screen (maximise) button on the title bar for the application you wish to show in split view.

Select either "Tile Window to Left of Screen" or "Tile Window to Right of Screen".

Click another window to display the applications side-by-side.

If you need to resize the windows, move the window splitter horizontally.
