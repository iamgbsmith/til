# Run Unsigned Applications

__Category: Mac__

Security in macOS Catalina has tightened controls on whether applications downloaded from the internet can be run. If you try to open an appliction that isnâ€™t registered with Apple by an identified developer you will get a warning dialog. There are two ways around this.

__Caveat:__ Ensure that you have verified the authenticity of the application you are about to run before proceeding. __Do not run any application that looks untrustworthy.__

### Remove the quarantine flag

Run the following command to remove the quarantine flag specifying the path to a binary or directory:

```
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/application
```

### Grant an exception in the security preferences

From the Apple menu  > System Preferences, click Security & Privacy, then click General. For the application you have tried to launch, grant an exception for a blocked appliction by clicking the Open Anyway button. 

This button is available for about an hour after you try to open the app.
