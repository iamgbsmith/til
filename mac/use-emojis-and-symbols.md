# Use Emojis And Symbols

__Category: Mac__

On macOS pressing `control + command + spacebar` shows the special character viewer allowing you to select from emojis and symbols.

You can switch from the compact view to the expanded view by pressing the icon in the upper right corner of the dialog.

Right-click on the character in the list and choose `Copy Character Info` to copy the Unicode details and UTF8 and the character into the clipboard.

If using the Unicode character in a Swift string, assuming a value of `Unicode: U+1F3C5` you can print as `"\u{1F943}"`.
