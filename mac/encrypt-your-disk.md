# Encrypt Your Disk

__Category: Mac__

For security reasons, you should encrypt your disk to protect confidential information and prevent data theft. FileVault full-disk encryption uses XTS-AES-128 encryption with a 256-bit key to help prevent unauthorised access to the information on your startup disk

To encrypt the disk on your Mac, open Preferences -> Security & Privacy. Select the FileVault tab and click the button "Turn On FileVault...".

Encryption occurs in the background and only while your Mac is running and plugged in to AC power. Once completed, the Security & Privacy preference will say *FileVault is turned on for the disk "Macintosh HD".*
