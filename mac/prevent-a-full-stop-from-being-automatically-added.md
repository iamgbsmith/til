# Prevent A Full Stop From Being Automatically Added 

__Category: Mac__

macOS Ventura enabled the keyboard setting which adds a full stop after a double space when typing text. 

To disable this setting, open Preferences.

Select Keyboard, then for Text Input, locate Input Sources and press the "Edit" button

Deselect the option "Add full stop with double-space".
