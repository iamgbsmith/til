# Responsive Design Mode In Safari

When developing web applications you can test the page layout for a device in Safari by pressing `control + command + R` to enable responsive design mode. This shortcut is an alternative to launching the Safari development tools.

Once you have validated the layout for the device, switch back to normal layout using `control + command + R`.
