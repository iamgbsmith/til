# Play Safari Videos Using Picture In Picture

__Category: Mac__

Most videos played in Safari can be watched while runnning other applications.

For example, in Youtube, right click on a video twice and select "Enter Picture In Picture".

The video will now float over the top of other applications. Resize the floating video window accordingly.

If the menu option doesn't show when playing a video, locate the audio icon in the Safari toolbar and right click it to bring up the "Enter Picture in Picture" option.
