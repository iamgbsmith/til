# Bulk Convert Image Format And Size

__Category: Mac__

You can bulk convert format and size for a collection of images using the Preview application. A scenario where you might need to do is converting photos captured on an iPhone in HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) format to PNG or JPEG.

### To convert image format

Open a collection of images using Preview.

Press `command + A` to select all images in the opened collection. These should show as selected in the thumbnail pane.

From the menu select File -> Export Select Images. From the dialog select `Options` to change the image format to the new target format. Selected another destination folder if required.

Press `Choose` and wait for the image format conversion to complete.

### To resize image format

Open a collection of images using Preview.

Press `command + A` to select all images in the opened collection. These should show as selected in the thumbnail pane.

From the menu select Tools -> Adjust Size. Select the desired pixel size or percentage to resize by then press `OK`.
