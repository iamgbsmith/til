# Prevent Applications From Starting Automatically

__Category: Mac__

Some applications or services will start automatically on macOS when logging in. This can slow your machine down over time.

To see which items are configured for auto-start, open Preferences.

Select General -> Login items.

Remove any applications from the list of "Open at Login" that you don't want to start automatically.

Deselect items from the list shown in "Allow in the background" that you don't want to run as a service.

Close Preferences.
