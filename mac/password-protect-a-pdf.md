# Password Protect A PDF

__Category: Mac__

You can password protect a PDF on macOS using the Preview application.

From the menu select File -> Export as PDF. Click the Show Details button, then select the Encrypt option.

Type a Password, then retype the same password into the Verify field.

You can optionally change the name of the file to retain the original PDF in unencrypted form.
