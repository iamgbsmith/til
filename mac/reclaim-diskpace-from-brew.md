# Reclaim Disk Space From Brew

__Category: Mac__

Homebrew's default behaviour is to automatically uninstall old versions of a formula every 30 days.

To see how much disk space can be manually relcaimed, run the following command:

```brew cleanup -n```

To cleanup files manually, run the following command:

```brew cleanup```
