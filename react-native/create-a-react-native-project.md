# Create A React Native Project

Create a React Native project from the command line as follows:

```shell
npx react-native init MyProject --template react-native-template-typescript
```

You should always use TypeScript as the template for React Native projects because it enhances readability and maintainability of code.

__Note:__ It is not possible to create a React Native project with a hyphen symbol in the name.
