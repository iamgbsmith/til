# What Is Hermes

__Category: React Native__

Hermes is an open-source JavaScript engine optimized for React Native. Enabling Hermes results in faster start-up, decreased memory usage, and smaller app size.

Hermes is an opt-in feature and must be enabled. 

When Hermes is installed and activated, you will see the message "Engine: Hermes" (with a version, for example, 0.9.0) in the welcome view.

See [Using Hermes](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes) for more details.
