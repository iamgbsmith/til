# What Is The Account-Based Model

__Category: Blockchain__

The account-based model (also known as the balance-based model) is used to structure a blockchain so that each wallet has a ledger of its own. Transactions either add or subtract from each wallet to provide a final balance. A transaction is valid if a sending account has enough balance to pay for it. 

Every transaction in the account-based model only needs to make one reference and signature that produces one output, which allows for substantial space savings on the blockchain, at the potential cost of scalability.

Ethereum uses the account-based blockchain model.
