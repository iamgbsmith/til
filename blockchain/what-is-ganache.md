# What Is Ganache

__Category: Blockchain__

Ganache is a standalone, virtual blockchain for local Ethereum development. It supports developing, deployment and testing of ERC-20 and ERC-721 dApps and smart contracts. 

It can function as a EIP-1193 provider, a `web3.js` provider, or an `ether.js` provider.

There are two ways of installing Ganache: 

- At the command-line using npm or yarn. For example: 
  - `npm install --global ganache` 
  - `yarn global add ganache`
- Or more easily, with the desktop application which is availble on Mac, Windows, or Linux.

On startup, Ganache will create 10 __test__ Ethereum addresses with a __simulated__ balance of 100 ETH. Blocks can be mined instantly, on demand, or at a set interval.
