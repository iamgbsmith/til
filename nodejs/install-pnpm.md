# Install PNPM

__Category: Nodejs__

PNPM is a package manager for Nodejs that functions as an alternative to npm and yarn. It delivers faster builds and reduces disk space use by linking files into global scope rather than coyping them from the cache.

A cross-platform way of installing PNPM globally is using npm:

```shell
npm install --global pnpm
```

To install on macOS using brew:

```shell
brew install pnpm
```

Confirm that PNPM is installed with the following command:

```shell
pnpm --version
```
