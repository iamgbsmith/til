# Check For Outdated Dependencies

__Category: Nodejs__

You can check for outdated dependencies in a Node project `package.json` file by running the following command:

```shell
yarn outdated
```

The output from this command will contain a list of the packages using semver showing:

* The current installed version
* The recommended (wanted) version 
* The latest version.

Sample output from this command:

```shell
yarn outdated v1.22.4

Always aim to upgrade to at least the wanted version for a package. Proceed with caution when upgrading to the latest version of a package as this may contain breaking changes.
