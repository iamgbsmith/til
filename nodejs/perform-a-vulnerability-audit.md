You can perform a vulnerability audit against package dependencies for a project.

The command will return with a non-zero exit code if there are issues of any severity found. Severity levels are:

* Critical
* High
* Moderate 
* Low
* Info

To audit across all dependency groups, including devDependencies:

```shell
yarn audit
```

To audit the dependencies group:

```shell
yarn audit --groups dependencies
```
