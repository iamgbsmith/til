# View Message Headers For Emails In Outlook

__Category: Office__

You might need to view message headers for emails in Outlook to validate their authenticity or provenance. 

Message headers show the mail server delivery path and can include other properties such as the spam score `X-Spam-Score` and whether the message has been virus scanned `X-Virus-Scanned`.

To show message headers in Outlook on Windows:

Double-click the email message to open it outside the reading pane.

From the message menu click File -> Info, then press "Properties".

Header information appears in the "Internet headers" text field.

Copy the contents of this field if you need view in an external editor.
