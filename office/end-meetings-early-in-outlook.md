# End Meetings Early In Outlook

__Category: Office__

Ending meetings early is a productivity hack that can help keep a meeting focused and provide you with more time in your day.

Outlook provides the ability to automatically end appointments and meetings earlier by a configurable amount of time.

From the Outlook menu, open File -> Options -> Calendar.

Select the option "Shorten appointments and meetings" and ensure "End early" is selected.

By default, meetings of less than one hour will end 5 minutes early. Meetings of more than one our will end 10 minutes early.

Change these values as required.

Existing meetings will not update automatically, so if you need to adjust them, change the end time by the suggested early end time.
