# Delay Sending Of Email Messages In Outlook

__Category: Office__

You can delay or schedule sending email messages in Outlook by setting a "not-before" send time. 

Delayed sending is useful if you want to let people know about something in a time-sensitive manner, for example a marketing campaign, or a reminder notice.

### Delayed send on Windows

In the message dialog, select Options in the menu then press "Delay Delivery" on the ribbon.

In the Deliver options section, select "Do not deliver before" and enter the date and time.

Close the dialog, then press Send on the email. It will remain in your Outbox until the specified delivery time has been met.
