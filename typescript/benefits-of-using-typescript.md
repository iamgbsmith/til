# Benefits Of Using TypeScript

__Category: TypeScript__

TypeScript from Microsoft is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. The key benefits of using TypeScript are:

* Type safety - static types can be added to JavaScript which allows for errors to be caught earlier in the development process when code is being written. This lowers potential bug count and application support costs.

* Maintainability and extensibility - types makes software easier to maintain and extend when compared to plain JavaScript. Applications are easier to debug and trace through.

* Developer onboarding - types make code easier to read and help developers to quickly understand the implementation without needing to continually rely on other team members to learn a new codebase.

* Portability - through transpiling with `tsc`, TypeScript allows for applications written using ES6, ES7, ES8 and future versions to work on every device, platform or browser that runs JavaScript.

* Easier refactoring - types make refactoring easier and increase confidence when making extensive changes or enhancements to applications.

* Deters cut-and-paste re-use - poorly written JavaScript will be harder to copy into a project written in TypeScript. No more blind cut-and-paste of dubious code from answers on Stack Overflow.

* Scaling front-end development - large and complex applications can be split up between teams by using functional partitioning. When team members need to move between functional areas it is easier for them to work on new areas of the codebase by relying on type inference and interfaces.

* Developer productivity - VSCode can provide code hints and code completion using IntelliSense. Other IDEs such as Atom, WebStorm and Sublime Text also provide enhanced developer productivity for TypeScript projects.

* Popularity - TypeScript is backed by Microsoft and is rapidly being adopted by projects and the developer community. Learning TypeScript will increase your marketability as a software engineer.
