# What Is GraalVM

__Category: Java__

GraalVM (Graal) is an Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler designed to accelerate the execution of applications written in Java and other JVM languages. It can create native binaries that start up instantly and deliver optimal performance with no warmup time. Application size is reduced providing the ability to create smaller container images.

Graal provides runtimes for JavaScript, Python, LLVM-based languages such as C and C++, and a number of other popular languages such as Ruby, R, and WASM. It can also compile JavaScript and Node.js applications to run on the JVM using fewer resources thereby providing better performance.

GraalVM is available in a community or enterprise version.

See [GraalVM](graalvm.org) for more details.
