# Install Ubuntu Linux Updates

__Category: Linux__

You can install Ubuntu updates from the command line with the following command:

```shell
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Review the list of available updates and press `y`, then enter to proceed with the upgrade process.

In some situations, for example when a new kernel becomes available, you may need to reboot your system after updating it.
