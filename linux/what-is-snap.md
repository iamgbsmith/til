# What Is Snap

__Category: Linux__

Snap is a software packaging and deployment system developed by Canonical for operating systems that use the Linux kernel and the systemd init system. Snap runs across a variety of Linux distros.

Packages are called _snaps_ which are self-contained applications running in a sandbox with limited access to the host system. Snapcraft is an app store for Linux and snaps are dependency free.

The Snap sandbox relies on the AppArmor Linux Security Module from the upstream Linux kernel.

See [About Snap](https://snapcraft.io/about) for more details.
