## Today I Learned

There have been many occassions during my career where I have done something in a hurry then promptly forgotten what I did months or years later causing significant angst or frustration. 

In these moments of haste, I would often think that what I was working on there and then could be useful in future but ended up moving on due to time pressures. What I should have actually done was to capture learnings for future reference irrespective of how trivial they might seem.

This collection of __Today I Learned__ snippets is a reference for my future self and a way for me to improve discipline with regards to documentation and knowledege sharing.
