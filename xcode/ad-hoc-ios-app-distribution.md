# Ad Hoc iOS App Distribution

__Category: Xcode__

Ad hoc distribution bypasses the App Store and allows you to build an iOS application for a maximum of 100 devices per device family, per year. It is an alternative to using TestFlight.

Apple enforces the device limit by requiring registation of each device’s Unique Device ID (UDID) in the Developer Portal. 

__Note: IPA files generated by Xcode using this process can only be installed onto devices where the UDID has been registered in the Apple Developer Portal.__

### Generating an iOS application for ad-hoc distribution

Create a provisioning profile from the Apple Developer website. You will need to generate Certificate Signing Requests for this. 

The provisioning profile should be downloaded into Xcode. Preferences | Accounts (Download)

Ensure the scheme is set for Release by Product | Scheme | Edit Scheme -> Release

Select “Generic iOS Device” from the Device menu

From the Product Menu select Clean

From the Product Menu select Archive

Once the archive has been created you will be presented with a dialog box

From the dialog select the application and then press “Distribute App”

Select “Ad Hoc”

App Thinning = None (if you use app thinning it will create additional IPA files)

Include manifest for over-the-air distribution = checked

For the Distribution manifest information settings specify (change the value of the URLs so that they resolve to a website under your control):

* Name = YourAppName

* App URL = https://www.yourwebsite.com/path/to/download/ios/YourAppName.ipa

* Display Image URL = https://www.yourwebsite.com/assets/images/ios/image.57x57.png

* Full Size Image URL = https://www.yourwebsite.com/assets/images/ios/image.512x512.png

### Install the application

Users should open a brower on their iOS device and navigate to the same URL specified in the App URL which resolves to location of the IPA file.
