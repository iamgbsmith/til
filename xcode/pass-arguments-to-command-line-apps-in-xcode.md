# Pass Arguments To Command Line Apps In Xcode

__Category: Xcode__

To pass arguments to a command-line application when running or debugging in Xcode, open the Scheme editor by selecting the menu option: Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme.

In the Run options, select "Arguments" and press the "+" button to add command line arguments.

Close the scheme editor dialog then run your app.

__Note:__ Arguments can not be edited once added. You will need to remove, then add them again if they need updating.
