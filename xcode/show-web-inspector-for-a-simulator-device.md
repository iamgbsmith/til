# Show Web Inspector For A Simulator Device

__Category: Xcode__

You can debug browser applications running on an iOS simulator locally using Web Inspector in desktop Safari. This may be useful when you need to see the JavaScript console log for mobile Safari.

Launch Safari on your desktop.

From the menu select Develop -> Simulator (Choose the appropriate simulator device) -> localhost

For example:

Develop -> Simulator - iPhone 13 Pro - iOS 15.2 (19C51) -> localhost

Interact with the Web Inspector in the usual way.
