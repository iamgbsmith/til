# Add A Simulator Device

__Category: Xcode__

Open Xcode. 

From the menu select Window -> Devices and Simulators. In the dialog, click on Simulators from the segment control then press the `+` button.
 
Create a new Simulator specifying the Simulator Name, for example 'iPhone Xr'. 

Choose the appropriate corresponding Device Type, then choose the OS Version you require. Note: You may need to download and install older versions of an OS if they are not installed locally. Do this by selecting the option "Download more simulator runtimes..." from the OS Version list.
 
The newly added simulator device should be available in the Simulator app from the menu, under File -> Open Simulator.
