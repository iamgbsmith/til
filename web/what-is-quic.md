# What Is QUIC

__Category: Web__

QUIC is a transport layer network protocol that underpins HTTP/3. It is based on UDP which delivers faster connection negotiation, encryption by default, and zero round-trip time (0-RTT).

The QUIC protocol was originally developed by Google in 2012 and was adopted and further enhanced by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for HTTP/3.

The following software components provide support for HTTP/3:

* Modern web browsers listed at [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=quic)
* Content delivery networks and load balancers - Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN, and Azure Application Gateway. 
* HTTP and reverse-proxy servers - Microsoft IIS, Nginx, Kestrel, LiteSpeed, and HAProxy.
