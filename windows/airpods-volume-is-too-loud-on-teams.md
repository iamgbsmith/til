# Airpods Volume Is Too Loud On Teams

__Category: Windows__

By defauit, Microsoft Windows will play Teams sound through Airpods at maximum volume.

You can lower volume using the Volume Mixer.

Right click on volume control in the system tray. Select "Open Volume mixer".

Lower the slider for Device (Headset) and Applications (Microsoft Teams) to the desired volume.

Setting the device volume to around 10% and Teams volume to 10% should make it tolerable.
