# Shorten Display Time For On Screen Volume Control

__Category: Windows__

Windows displays the on-screen volume control for too long (approximately 13 seconds) which covers the top left corner of the screen.

To reduce this timeout, open system Settings -> Ease of Access display settings.

Scroll down and change the value of "Show notifications for" to 5 seconds.

This setting will also potentially reduce the time for diplaying other system notifications on screen allowing you to focus more easily.
