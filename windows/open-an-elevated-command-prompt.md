# Open An Elevated Command Prompt

__Category: Windows__

Some commands may show the message "Use an elevated command prompt to complete these tasks." 

To open an elevated command prompt, press the Windows key and type Command Prompt.

In the search results, right click on Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator".

Re-run your command.

You can also use the same approach for elevated permissions in PowerShell.
