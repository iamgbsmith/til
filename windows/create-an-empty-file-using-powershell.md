# Create An Empty File Using PowerShell

__Category: Windows__

`New-Item` can be used as the Windows equivalent of the Linux `touch` command in PowerShell.

For example, to create an empty, zero-byte file called `notes.txt` enter the following command:

```command
New-Item notes.txt
```

__Note:__ `New-Item` can be replaced with its alias `ni`.
