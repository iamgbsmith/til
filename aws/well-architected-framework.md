# Well-Architected Framework

__Category: AWS__

AWS promotes the Well-Architected Framework as an approach to help you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud.

The Well-Architected framework has five pillars:

* Operational Excellence - focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continually improving processes and procedures. For example, automating changes with deployment pipelines, or responding to events that are triggered.

* Security - emphasizes checking integrity of data and protecting systems by applying security at all layers. For example, using encryption in-flight and at-rest, and automating security best practices when possible.

* Reliability - focuses on recovery planning and how you handle change to meet business and customer demand. For example, recovering from data-loss or EC2 node failure and service disruption.

* Performance Efficiency - entails using IT and computing resources efficiently as business needs evolve. For example, using the right EC2 type based on workload and memory requirements.

* Cost Optimization - looks at optimizing full cost and controlling where money is spent to deliver business value at the lowest price point. For example, validating EC2 server size so that it is the most effective from a cost perspective.
