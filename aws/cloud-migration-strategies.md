# Cloud Migration Strategies

__Category: AWS__

AWS recommends six different migration strategies (referred to as the "6 Rs model") for cloud modernisation projects.

* Rehost - (also known as “lift and shift”) involves moving an application to the cloud without making changes to it.

* Replatform - (also known as “lift, tinker, and shift”) involves making a few cloud optimisations to realise a tangible benefit (i.e. using an AWS database). Optimisation is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application.

* Repurchase - (also known as "drop-and-shop") involves moving from a traditional license to a Software-as-a-Service model. Services could be purchased from the AWS Marketplace and Service Catalog.

* Refactor - (also known as re-architecting) involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features. This typically comes with the highest initial cost.

* Retire - consists of removing applications that are no longer needed. The application is deprecated in-place. 

* Retain - keeps applications that are critical for the business in the source environment. This might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated, or work that can be postponed until a future date.
