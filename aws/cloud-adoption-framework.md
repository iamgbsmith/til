# Cloud Adoption Framework

__Category: AWS__

AWS promotes their Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) to organise guidance into six areas of focus, called Perspectives. Each Perspective addresses distinct responsibilities. 

* Business capabilities focus on the perspectives of Business, People, and Governance. 
* Technical capabilties focus on the perspectives of Platform, Security, and Operations.

### Business Perspective

Ensures that IT aligns with business needs and that IT investments link to key business results. Use this perspective to create a strong business case for cloud adoption and prioritise cloud adoption initiatives.

### People Perspective

Supports development of an organization-wide change management strategy for successful cloud adoption. Use this perspective to evaluate organisational structures and roles, new skill and process requirements, and identify gaps which can be addressed by training or hiring.

### Governance Perspective 

Focuses on the skills and processes to align IT strategy with business strategy. Use this perspective to ensure that you maximize the business value and minimise risks.

### Platform Perspective 

Includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions on the cloud, and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud. This perspective uses architectural models to communicate the target state environment in detail.

### Security Perspective

Ensures that an organisation meets security objectives for visibility, auditability, control, and agility. This perspective is used to structure the selection and implementation of security controls that meet the organisationâ€™s requirements.

### Operations Perspective

Helps to enable, run, use, operate, and recover IT workloads to the level agreed upon with business stakeholders. This perspective helps stakeholders define current operating procedures and identify the process changes and training needed to implement successful cloud adoption.
