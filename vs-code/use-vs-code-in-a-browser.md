# Use VS Code In A Browser

__Category: VS Code__

You can use an online version of VS Code by opening https://vscode.dev

To enable easier loading of GitHub repos, add the VS Code extension to Chrome or Edge.

Type "code" into the browser address bar to activate the search omnibox.

Type the name of a GitHub repository and press Enter. If the repository can't be found enter the `<owner>/<repo>` to open it. For example, `iamgbsmith/react-wordle`
