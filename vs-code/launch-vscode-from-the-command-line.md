# Launch VS Code From The Command Line

__Category: VS Code__

To open VS Code from the command line in the current directory, ensure that you have the VS Code command line tools installed. Windows will add the tools to your path automatically.

On macOS, open VS Code and show the Command Palette with `shift + command + P` then type:

```shell
Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command
```

Select this option.

Next time you want to use VS Code, open it from the current directory using:

```shell
code .
```
